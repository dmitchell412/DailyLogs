\subsection{Original Phantom Recipe}

\textbf{Egg White Phantom:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1.5\% agar
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 15 g agar for 1-L phantom volume (can go as low as 10 g, but not as firm), i.e. 1.5 g per 100 mL
		\item food grade agar powder $\sim$\$8 from Amazon
		\item clinical grade (white bottle, red cap) $\sim$\$250
	\end{itemize}
	\item 2/3 volume distilled water
	\item 1/3 volume liquid egg whites
\end{itemize}
\underline{Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Keep egg whites warm (under $60^\circ \mathrm{C}$) - hot plate with stir bar in beaker $\sim 50^\circ \mathrm{C}$
	\item Put agar powder in water before heating - hot plate with stir bar in beaker
	\item Heat water and agar to $80$-$90^\circ \mathrm{C}$ to dissolve agar powder, will become translucent when ready (can use 2510 Branson sonicare to eliminate bubbles while stirring)
	\item Let water and agar cool to $\sim 60^\circ \mathrm{C}$ while stirring
	\item Pour egg whites into beaker with water and agar
	\item Remove stir bars from beaker
	\item Slowly pour solution into container and let cool until it sets
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Second Scan Recipes}

\textbf{1 Agar Phantom:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1.5\% agar (T1 = 2640 ms) (Mathur-De Vre et al, 1985)
	\item 350 mL total volume $\longrightarrow$ 5.25 g agar
	\item cylindrical hole left for fat reference (allow to set)
	\item trimmed container top first, covered with Al foil
\end{itemize}

\textbf{1 Agar + Gd Phantom:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1.5\% agar and 0.14 mM Gd
	\begin{itemize}
		\item T1 = 791 ms (Walker et al, 1989)
		\item (White matter T1 = 832 ms) (Wansapura et al, 1999)
	\end{itemize}
	\item 350 mL total volume $\longrightarrow$ 5.25 g agar
	\item Gd dilution:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $C_1V_1=C_2V_2$
		\item $C_1 = 2.43 \mathrm{\ mM\ Gd}$
		\item $V_1=C_2V_2/C_1=\left(0.14 \mathrm{\ mM\ Gd}\right)\left(350 \mathrm{\ mL}\right)/\left(2.43 \mathrm{\ mM\ Gd}\right)=20.16 \mathrm{\ mL\ Gadodiamide}$
	\end{itemize}
	\item cylindrical hole left for fat reference (allow to set)
	\item trimmed container top first, covered with Al foil
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fat References:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1.5\% agar
	\item 200 mL total volume $\longrightarrow$ 3.0 g agar
	\item 1:1 water:Crisco $\longrightarrow$ 100 mL water, 100 mL Crisco
	\item 1 Lecithin pill to disolve Crisco in water
	\item heat and stir until $80^\circ \mathrm{C}$ and comlete dissolution
	\item pour slowly and fill cylindrical hole left in phantom
\end{itemize}
